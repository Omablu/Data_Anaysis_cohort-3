# Data_Anaysis_cohort-3

This is the first task given to me since I started the data Analysis cohort 3 with **Promise Chinonso**

## Introduuction
As part of the learning process of the third data analysis cohort organized by **Promise Chinonso**, we were assigned the task of creating a table of information, which consisted of 20 rows and 5 columns and included the following information: Employee ID, Employee Full Name, Department, Salary and Job Type. We were also provided a Sales dataset to manipulate and deduce pieces of information.

## Activity 1
- We are to show the employees working as freelancers and earning above $10,000.
- Split the employees' full names into first names and last names, highlighting any form of duplicate value in the table.
- Highlight employees whose names start with **E** in yellow color, and highlight the highest salary value in green and the lowest salary value in red.

## Activity 2
Using the sales dataset provided, we should determine;
- The total Revenue and Profit generated
- The average Revenue and Units Sold for every order
- The total Discount, given in $
- Total number of sales recorded
- The highest Profit generated
- Create a column named ‘Sales Range’, and return ‘High Sales’ if the Sales value is above average, otherwise, return ‘Low Sales’.
- The average revenue generated from each sale of ‘Paseo’
- The number of sales made in the Government and Midmarket segment
- The total revenue generated from the sales of ‘Montana’ in Canada
- In which Country, Segment, and Month was the highest unit of goods sold?
- What is the total profit made in December?

## Skills Demonstrated
1. Data Manipulation
2. Use of Conditional Formatting
3. Use of Filters
4. Text-to-Column
5. Concatenate
6. functions like Vlookup, Xlookup, Sum, Sumif, Sumifs
7. Average, Averageif, Count, CountA, If, Countif etc

## Dataset 1
First Data manipulation, I applied the filter function and filtered out just the freelancers and highlighted the employees earning above $10,000

Using the concatenate function
I used the concatenate function to separate the employee names into first names and last names

Using conditional formatting, I formatted the employee names starting with the letter "E" and highlighted it in Yellow, and also formatted the highest and lowest salaries in green and red simultaneously.

Using the sales dataset above, I calculated the total revenue, profit, unit sold, average profit, highest and lowest revenue generated.

Using the same dataset I was able to use the functions Sum, sumif, vlookup, countA, Average, averageif, if, to generate insigts.

I created new columns to be able to use the Vlookup function, IF, and also the "LEFT" function.

## Conclusion
I have learned a great deal playing around with my first Excel dataset to gain different insights.
I hope to learn more and showcase more skills to my future employer.
